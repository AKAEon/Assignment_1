## Introduction

Mental health disorder refers to the abnormal performance of an individual's psychological function, which affects his or her normal thinking, emotion, behavior and social functions. These disorders can span a wide spectrum, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, schizophrenia, somatoform disorders, and more. Mental health disorders can significantly impact a patient's quality of life, making it difficult for them to work, study and socialize normally. The impact is not limited to the patient himself, but also affects his family, social circle and workplace. At the same time, it may cause patients to pose dangers to themselves and others, such as suicide, violent behavior, etc., which poses a potential threat to both the patient himself and society. As people's awareness of mental health increases, so does the focus on mental health issues. People are increasingly aware of the close relationship between mental health and overall health, so the level of attention paid to mental health issues is also increasing. Mental health problems are common across the globe, regardless of age, race, gender or social status. Therefore, their scope of influence is very wide and needs to be fully valued and paid attention to.

By analyzing global trends in mental health disorders, we try to reveal the influencing factors of their occurrence and eliminate social prejudice and discrimination against mental illness. Through scientific research and education, we can help the public better understand mental health issues, reduce discrimination and stigmatization of patients, and provide them with more support and understanding. At the same time, it can help governments and international organizations better formulate relevant policies and plans and rationally allocate resources. According to the needs of different regions and groups, mental health services and support are provided in a targeted manner to solve the mental health challenges faced by different regions and groups. It can also help to detect the development trends of mental health problems and high-risk groups early, so that effective prevention and intervention measures can be taken. By establishing early intervention mechanisms, strengthening mental health education and providing mental health services, the occurrence and development of mental health problems can be reduced and the mental health of the population can be promoted. In addition, new research directions and challenges can be discovered through the analysis of global trends. With changes in society, economy, and environment, new mental health problems or changing trends in original problems may emerge, and research priorities and strategies need to be adjusted in a timely manner to meet new challenges.
